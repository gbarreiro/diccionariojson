# JSON dictionary
Python program for managing a key-value database, stored as a JSON file. This program can interact with the database, allowing you to query, create, modify and delete entries.

# Usage

`python3 jsondictionary.py [file_name.json]`

If file name is not set, default `file.json` will be used. If there is not a file with that name yet, the program will create it.
